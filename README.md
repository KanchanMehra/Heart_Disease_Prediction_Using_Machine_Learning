# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
Heart disease has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Data-driven systems, powered by Machine Learning, can greatly improve heart disease prediction, ensuring timely prevention and healthier lives. This project aims to leverage ML algorithms for predicting heart disease with high accuracy, aiding in early detection and preventive care.

The dataset was carefully analyzed and processed, followed by training various machine learning models to predict heart disease presence. The goal is to build a model that provides accurate predictions based on a set of input features, classifying the target variable as either indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Key Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy Achieved:
90.16% (Random Forest)
